  <b>launchbox</b>: an open-source Roblox launcher.
</p>

## Overview
- **Native multi-account support.** Add accounts through Roblox's own authentication process and switch between them easily without having to re-login between accounts every time.
- **Browser-based navigation.** The built-in browser allows you to use the Roblox website directly to add experiences, VIP servers, and accounts to the launcher. No need to go through weird, unofficial forms.
- **Looks and feels good.** Featuring an animated and reactive user interface that can be styled with stylesheets if desired, it will automatically switch between light and dark mode based on your system settings.
- **Cross-platform.** It works on both Windows _and_ macOS!

## Roadmap
- [x] Native browser with cookie and session access.
- [x] User authentication and session reuse through the browser.
- [x] Quick join through launching a game with the browser.
- [x] Save favorite games to the launcher directly for convenience.
- [x] Thumbnails for account headshots and games.
- [ ] Join through Job IDs, private VIP server invites and friends.
- [ ] Additional user configuration (specific Roblox versions? Fast flags?)
